/**
 * Cluster Themes: redraws the iDrive 7 instrument cluster (the 1920x720 "panel" target) through cluster-render.
 *
 * The center screen is the app's settings page (app.json "screens" MAIN, a menu with
 * "settings": true): a status line, then the theme, room for the map, units, redline and which readouts
 * show. The kit builds that page and saves each choice in the app's data/settings.json;
 * the shared engine (hud.js) listens and redraws the cluster at once. It keeps running after the page is
 * closed (OAP apps stay up in the background), so the page is only needed for changes.
